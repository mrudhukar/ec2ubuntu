1. Clone the repos from git instead of rsync (Steps in Readme), also move the rest of the readme to shell script
2. Comment about the minimum kernel version required for debootstrap lucid
3. Make the ebs option work, this is not working currently we need to pass the build dir options to the external script (ec2onrails script)
